**RequestConverter** - Convert request bundles from Fiddler, Wireshark etc into clean, readable code. Current support for C# & Python

**Early production version**: https://requestconverter.web.app/

Very much early days on a web app that will allow you to upload request bundles (such as .SAZ on Fiddler) and view them in different programming languages on the user interface, with abilities and options to modify data output.

**Roadmap:**

- Ability to save request bundle as link (rq.com/r/9OBAi1/1)
- Ability to import Wireshark (currently only supports Fiddler files)
- Include more programming languages (Java/Rust/Perl/Go/Kotlin...)
- Add settings to change the programming output & theme etc.
- Ability to save request bundle to account (login/register features)
- Recode RequestConverter in React, Vue & Blazor (learning experience)
